# Social-Media-Data-Exploration
Working with social media data exported from Kaggle. 
Worked with SQL Alchemy to create a table in the database and insert the data from the social media csv table extracted from Kaggle.
I leveraged Pandas to explore and clean the data for adequate analysis and visualization.
